# HNU Solar Online Tool version 1.0
-----------------------
This is an online tool for calculating the solar heat gain of occupants in buildings.

This tool is developed by Yingdong He and Jing Yuan, at University of California, Berkeley.

The original mathematical model is from the paper of Yingdong He et al. (Yingdong He, Edward Arens, Nianping Li, et al. Modeling solar radiation on a human body indoors by a novel mathematical model. Building and Environment, 2021, 187: 107421).

The method of reading climatic parameters from epw files is from # [epwvis](http://mdahlhausen.github.io/epwvis).

EPW files can be downloaded from [epwmap](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/epwmap) or the [EnergyPlus weather](https://energyplus.net/weather) website.
